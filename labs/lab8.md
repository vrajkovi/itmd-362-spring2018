# Lab 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be
an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or 
two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a 
list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT 
redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Individual Basecamp Deliverable:

A. Photograph of the object.

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:

* Behavioral:

* Reflective:

C. Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:
