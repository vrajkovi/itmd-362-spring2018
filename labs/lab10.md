# Lab 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, 
describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Individual deliverables to basecamp

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop.

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test.

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test
 (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however).
