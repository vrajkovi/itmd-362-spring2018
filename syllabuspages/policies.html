        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          <b>From the Catalog</b>: Students in this course will learn the importance of
          human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The
          course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as
          usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use
          design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site
          engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and
          construction of user-centered Web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Extended Description</b>: Additionally, this course favors a mobile-first approach to
          web design and development, with special attention to the challenges of designing
          touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping and
          rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design
          principles the course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography,
          and responsive grid-based page layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and
          thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies and polyfills will be treated
          as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around projects of
          varying size and scale, emphasizing the course's hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web
          design and development.
        </p>

      <section id="assignments">
        <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
        <p>
          All major projects for this course will be submitted via Basecamp.
          Submissions should <b>not</b> include attachments, but rather URLs
          pointing to your project’s GitHub repository and live link.
          Examples will be demonstrated in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>All HTML and CSS in projects and lab submissions must pass validation</b> with the
          <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3c CSS validator</a>.
          Any work whose HTML does not validate will receive a zero-point, failing grade. Get in the habit early of validating your HTML each 
          time before you commit your work to GitHub.
        </p>
        <h3>Late Work</h3>
        <p>
          I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
          in each project description.
        </p>
        <h3>Comments and Participation</h3>
        <p>
          I will check to see that you are adding proper summaries of your GitHub commits. You are also expected to help other students on Basecamp. 
          This means polite give-and-take discussions of code. Do not discuss anything else on basecamp. Practice professional and supportive critiquing. 
      </section>
      <section id="technology-policy">
        <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
          essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
          technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
          acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
          it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
          provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage
          all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I
          prefer that you contact me via Basecamp Ping, email, or GChat well in advance of assignment
          and project deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
          up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
          is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
          important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
          before a project is due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
          accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
          certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
          also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a
          collaborator, for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high
          value of establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias.
          Public accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your
          online presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when
          they look for you on Google and elsewhere.

      <section id="academic-integrity">
        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
        <p>
          As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
          <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
          as described in the
          <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
          work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
          design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
          open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
          legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
          dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
          source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
          part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
          the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
          violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
          a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
          Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
          violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
        </p>

      <section id="special-needs">
        <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
        <p>
          I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all
          students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented
          disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of
          accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a
          href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower,
          3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at
          312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135, or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
        </p>
        <p>
          Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
          ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
          at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
          or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
          students.
